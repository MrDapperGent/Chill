# ChiLL, the node-based editor for IceSL

![ChiLL banner][banner]

## What is Chill?
Chill is a **node-based editor** for [**IceSL**, the **Modeler and Slicer**](https://icesl.loria.fr).

Created by members of the team behind IceSL, ChiLL aims to provide a **Visual Programming** interface for IceSL.

Because IceSL offers the possibility to directly create models using Lua scripting, ChiLL provide a way to create those modeling scripts using an approach based on Visual Programming. No need to code or learn the scripting language!

>**Note**
>ChiLL is easily extendable, all nodes are IceSL scripts themselves.

## How to install ChiLL?

>**Note**
>First and foremost, install [IceSL](https://icesl.loria.fr/download/).
>Once this is done, you have everything required to run a pre-build version of Chill!

### Pre-build versions
For both [Windows][win_zip] and [Linux][linux_zip] based systems, ChiLL is available as a **.zip** containing pre-build executables and nodes to provide a quick start!

### Installers

#### On Windows
For Windows users, [.msi][win_msi] installer is available.

#### On Linux
For Linux users, a [.deb][deb_install] is available for **Debian-based** distributions.

### From Source
ChiLL can also be used direcly from the source code, by **building and compiling** the project manually. To do so, please [see the section below](#build-chill).

## How to build ChiLL? <a name ="build-chill"> 
To build ChiLL, you will need the following components installed on your computer:

- git
- CMake
- C++ 17 standard libraries
- Any IDE supporting C++ (on windows, Visual Studio is recommended)

Once the required components installed, you can fetch the source code by cloning or downloading a .zip of the source files.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/shapeforge/Chill.git
```

Initialize and fetch the submodules dependencies.

```Shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```

>**Note**
>If you have some trouble compiling Chill for Linux, try to **checkout LibSL** to the **unix_compile branch**.

You can now build the project for your IDE of choice using CMAKE, and then compile.

## How to Use ChiLL?
Once ChiLL is opened -- and IceSL alongside it -- you can access a menu containing the different nodes by doing a right-click on the working space.

![Nodes Menu][node_menu]

Once there, you can select an input-node.

![Using an input-node][input_node]

You can now select an output-node and link the nodes. To do this click and drag a link from the output of the first node to the input of the second node.

![Linking nodes][linking_nodes]

At launch time, ChiLL opens IceSL to produce a preview of the geometry generated by the nodes. You can modify the parameters of any node interactively by typing or dragging values. The modifications are immediately reflected in the preview of the object rendered in IceSL.

You can then save the produced graph for later use, or you can export it as a .lua file tailored for IceSL.
